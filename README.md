# Auto-Jug System Update Manager (AJ-SUM)

Yo, whatâ€™s good, fam? Meet the **Auto-Jug System Update Manager (AJ-SUM)**â€”a straight-up beast I, Bigawn, crafted with blood, sweat, and heart, dropped on March 09, 2025! This ainâ€™t no gimmick; itâ€™s a powerful, cross-platform remote administration tool (RAT) I built from the ground up to give you full control over systems. Itâ€™s designed to run hard across Windows (XP to 11), macOS (1.0 to 15, with extra love for 14.5), and all the Linux flavors (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Kali, TailsOS)â€”32-bit or 64-bit, Intel or ARM, I got it locked down for you!

### The Vision
AJ-SUM is a legit RAT built for system management and data handling. Itâ€™s my way of droppinâ€™ a tool that lets you monitor, manage, and extract info from any compatible machine. I poured my soul into makinâ€™ it universal, so whether youâ€™re rockinâ€™ an old PC or a new MacBook, you can harness its power. This is raw, hands-on tech for the crashouts who know how to use it right.

### Features That Slap
- **Cross-Platform Power**: Runs like a champ on Windows, macOS, and Linuxâ€”Intel, ARM, 32-bit, 64-bit, fully supported.
- **Stealth Operations**: Sets up persistent access with LaunchAgents, systemd, or cron, keepinâ€™ it runninâ€™ smooth and quiet.
- **Auto-Update System**: Downloads updates and installs dependencies on its own, with fake update screens to mask activity.
- **Data Harvestinâ€™**: Pulls system details, browser logins, and moreâ€”encrypted and sent via Discord webhooks for secure exfiltration.
- **Keylog Functionality**: Tracks keystrokes across platforms (Quartz on macOS, Xlib on Linux, Windows hooks) for real-time input monitoring.
- **Anti-Forensic Tools**: Wipes logs, shreds traces, and cleans journals to keep your tracks covered.
- **C2 Command Control**: Fetches and executes commands from fallback URLs with threaded precision for remote management.
- **Self-Destruct Mode**: Wipes itself clean when youâ€™re doneâ€”no evidence left behind.

### Why I Built This
This is my creation, straight from Bigawn to you. AJ-SUM is a RAT for those who need to manage systems remotely, harvest data, or test security setups. Itâ€™s educational, itâ€™s functional, and itâ€™s for the crashouts who wanna dive deep into system control. I kept it real with legit design and smooth executionâ€”pure skill in code form.

### Get In on the Action
Grab this repo, run the scripts (`auto-jug.bat`, `auto-jug.sh`, `auto-jug-macos.sh`), and let AJ-SUM do its thing. Tweak it, learn from it, and use it responsibly. Drop issues or pull requests if you wanna collabâ€”letâ€™s build this tech together, fam!

### Disclaimer
This is a remote administration tool for educational and testing purposes only. Use it legally and ethicallyâ€”I ainâ€™t liable for any misuse. Keep it 100 and stay safe.
